Additionally, it enables follow-up questions and deeper exploration of topics, marking a significant upgrade to Google's search capabilities, while updates to AI Overviews are also planned.\n",

The Act introduces a classification system categorizing AI systems into four levels of risk: prohibited systems, high-risk systems requiring evaluation, medium-risk systems with specific transparency obligations, and low-risk systems without special requirements. The Act addresses critical issues like the prohibition of exploitation of vulnerable individuals and outlawing biometric identification for public surveillance. The regulation is expected to evolve regularly to keep pace with the fast developments in AI.\n",

The Act introduces a classification system categorizing AI systems into four levels of risk: prohibited systems, high-risk systems requiring evaluation, medium-risk systems with specific transparency obligations, and low-risk systems without special requirements. The Act addresses critical issues like the prohibition of exploitation of vulnerable individuals and outlawing biometric identification for public surveillance. The regulation is expected to evolve regularly to keep pace with the fast developments in AI.</p>\n",
